# UNDER-WATER-IMAGE-ENHANCEMENT-AND-RESTORATION-USING-AI-ML
In this project, we are developing a Under Water Image Enhancement and Restoration. The main objective of the Project is to reduce the noises in the Underwater Images. We propose some methods for efficient removal of Noises using Image Processing Techniques
In this project, we are developing a Under Water Image Enhancement and Restoration. 
The main objective of the Project is to reduce the noises in the Underwater Images.
We propose some methods for efficient removal of Noises using Image Processing Techniques. The Underwater images have low quality which makes it a difficult process to analyze the images. 
Here we propose Image Enhancement and Image Restoration process for increasing the quality of Underwater Images. CLAHE, Rayleigh distribution, DCP and MIP, RGHS, ULAP methods are used in this project.
